# Phantasia Collections Reorganization

## Overview
【✓】
This document summarizes the reorganization of the Prismatic Collections website structure, particularly focusing on the Phantasia section's header components and layout organization. The reorganization improves code consistency, simplifies the navigation structure, and provides better component organization.

## Key Changes

### 1. Header Component Standardization
【✓】
- Standardized the site to use only one `SiteHeaderComponent` from the shared components directory
- Removed duplicate header implementations:
  - `src/app/components/header/header.component.*` files deleted
  - Redundant header rendering in page components removed
- Integrated the site-header component directly in layout components:
  - `PhantasiaLayoutComponent` now imports and uses `SiteHeaderComponent`
  - `HomeComponent` directly imports and uses `SiteHeaderComponent`
- Fixed style imports by using `collection-header-global.scss` consistently

### 2. Unused Components Removal
【✓】
- Removed `ScrollDemoComponent` from routes and navigation menus
- Deleted `PhantasiaProjectComponent` directory as it wasn't being used
- Removed `main-layout` component in favor of per-page layouts
- Deleted mobile-layout component files

### 3. Layout Structure Reorganization
【✓】
- Moved layout components closer to the pages they serve:
  - Relocated `phantasia-layout` from `src/app/layout/` to `src/app/pages/collections/phantasia/layout/`
  - Renamed files from `phantasia-layout.component.*` to `layout.component.*`
- Updated all import paths and routing references to reflect the new structure
- Implemented a per-page layout approach instead of global layouts
- Simplified the routing structure by organizing routes by section

### 4. Routing Path Updates
【✓】
- Updated routing paths from `/phantasia/introduction` to `/phantasia/phantasia`
- Added redirects for backward compatibility
- Consolidated routing in `app.routes.ts`
- Organized routes by sections (Main, Phantasia, Direct Access, Mobile)

## Benefits of Reorganization

1. **Improved Code Organization**: Layout components are now co-located with the pages they serve
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated duplicate header implementations
3. **Simplified Navigation**: Standardized routing patterns and naming conventions
4. **Better Maintainability**: Per-page layout approach makes changes more localized
5. **Consistent Styling**: Global header styling applied consistently across all pages

## Documentation Updates

The reorganization is documented in several key files:
- `src/app/pages/collections/phantasia/layout/README.md` - PhantasiaLayoutComponent details
- `src/app/pages/collections/phantasia/LAYOUT.md` - Layout architecture explanation
- `src/routing-summary.md` - Updated routing configuration overview
- This file (`REORGANIZATION.md`) - Summary of all changes

## Development Guidelines
【✓】
1. Always use the shared `SiteHeaderComponent` for headers
2. Add new Phantasia pages as children of the PhantasiaLayoutComponent
3. Follow the established routing patterns for consistency
4. Place layout components close to the pages they serve
5. Maintain the per-page layout approach rather than creating global layouts
